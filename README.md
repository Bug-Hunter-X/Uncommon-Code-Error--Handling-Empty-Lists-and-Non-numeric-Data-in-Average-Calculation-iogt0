This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a potential error in calculating the average of a list, specifically when the list is empty or contains non-numeric elements.  The `bug.py` file showcases the original code, while `bugSolution.py` provides an improved version with better error handling.  The error is subtle and can be easily overlooked but is important for robust code.
